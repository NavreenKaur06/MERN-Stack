Day 21 – [18th July 2025]

TOPICS COVERED

Backend – CRUD Operations and Authentication

1. CRUD Operations (Using Mongoose)
What is CRUD?
Basic operations to manage data in a database:
Create: Adding new data (e.g. user registration).
Read: Retrieving data (e.g. get user profile).
Update: Modifying existing data (e.g. edit profile).
Delete: Removing data (e.g. delete account).

Why is CRUD important?
Forms the backbone of any backend application dealing with databases.

2. Token (JWT – JSON Web Token)
What is a token?
A string of data used for authentication. After login, the server sends a token to the client, which is then used for further requests.

What is JWT?
JSON Web Token – a secure way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object.

Why use JWT?
•Stateless authentication (no need to store session on server).
•Can store user info securely with signature verification.

3. Header-Based Authentication
What is it?
Sending tokens in the HTTP headers (usually in the Authorization header) for authenticating protected routes.

How it works?
•Client sends request with token in headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
•Server verifies the token to grant or deny access.

Why use header-based authentication?
Keeps tokens secure, prevents exposure in URLs or body, and is widely used in APIs.

TOOLS USED
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Node.js, Express.js
MongoDB + Mongoose
JWT (jsonwebtoken package)
