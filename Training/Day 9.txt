Day 9 – [1st July 2025]

TOPICS COVERED

JavaScript DOM

1. innerText
Gets or sets the visible text content of an element, excluding hidden elements and considering CSS styles.

2. textContent
Gets or sets all text content of an element, including hidden text. Slightly faster than innerText as it does not consider styling.

3. innerHTML
Gets or sets the HTML content inside an element. It can read or replace HTML tags and content within.

4. getAttribute()
Used to get the value of an attribute of an HTML element.
Example: Get the src of an image or the href of a link.

5. setAttribute()
Used to set or update an attribute of an element.
Example: Change the id, class, or src dynamically.

6. Adding Elements (Creating Nodes)
Using methods like:
document.createElement() to create a new element.
appendChild() to add it as the last child.
insertBefore() to insert before a specific node.
innerHTML += to add content (not preferred for nodes).
7. Removing Elements
removeChild() to remove a specific child node from its parent.
element.remove() directly removes the element from DOM.

8. DOM Events
Events are actions like click, input, submit, mouseover, keydown etc. You can:
Use onclick, onchange in HTML directly, or
Use addEventListener() method for better practice to attach event handlers dynamically.

 TOOLS USED
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Google Chrome (Developer Tools – Elements tab, Console tab)
