Day 7 â€“ [27th June 2025]

TOPICS COVERED

JavaScript Functions

1. Function Calling
Calling or invoking a function means executing it using its name followed by parentheses.

2. Return Function
Functions can return a value using the return statement, which can then be stored in a variable or used directly.

3. Block Scope of var and let
var is function scoped (accessible throughout the function).

let is block scoped (accessible only within the block {} where it is declared).

4. Arrow Function
A shorter way to write functions using =>. They are concise and do not have their own this binding.

5. Higher Order Function
Functions that take other functions as parameters or return functions. Useful in functional programming and callbacks.

6. Callback Function
A function passed as an argument to another function to be executed after some operation or event.
