TOPICS COVERED

React.js Concepts
1. Reconciliation
What is it?
Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the DOM efficiently when the state or props of a component change.

How does it work?
React creates a virtual DOM (a lightweight copy of the real DOM). When changes occur:
•It compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one (diffing).
•Only the changed parts are updated in the real DOM (efficient updates).

Why is it important?
Improves performance by avoiding full page reloads and unnecessary DOM manipulations.

2. Async Nature of useState
What is it?
useState updates are asynchronous. When you call the state update function, React does not immediately update the state value.

Why?
React batches state updates for performance. The updated state value is available after re-rendering.

Important Point:
If you try to read the state immediately after updating it in the same function, you will still get the old value. Use useEffect or check after re-render to get the updated value.
