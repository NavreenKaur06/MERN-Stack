TOPICS COVERED

JavaScript Array Methods

1. .map()
Used to transform each element of an array and return a new array. It applies a function to every element without modifying the original array.

2. .filter()
Returns a new array with only those elements that satisfy a certain condition. It’s used for selecting or filtering elements based on logic.

3. .reduce()
Used to reduce the array to a single value by performing a function on each element cumulatively. Commonly used for summing or combining values.

JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) – Introduction
1. What is DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the browser’s internal representation of a webpage. It treats the page as a tree structure with elements like <html>, <body>, <div>, etc., as nodes.

2. Why DOM?
It allows JavaScript to dynamically read, modify, add, or remove HTML elements, attributes, and content—enabling interactivity and real-time updates on webpages.

3. Accessing Elements
Elements in the DOM can be accessed using methods like by ID, class name, tag name, or using query selectors.

4. Modifying DOM
JavaScript can change text, styles, attributes, and structure of the webpage by manipulating the DOM tree.

TOOLS USED
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Google Chrome (Developer Tools – Elements tab, Console tab)
