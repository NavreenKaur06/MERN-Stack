Day 4 – [24th June 2025]

TOPICS COVERED (JAVASCRIPT BASICS)

Introduction to Hoisting
Hoisting is JavaScript’s default behavior of moving declarations (variables and functions) to the top of their scope before code execution.

Example:
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 10;  
// Behind the scenes: var a; 
console.log(a); // undefined a = 10;

Hoisting applies to var declarations and function declarations, but not let and const.

Introduction to Coercion
Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another.

Example:
console.log('5' + 2);  // "52" (number 2 is coerced to string)
console.log('5' - 2);  // 3 (string '5' is coerced to number)

There are two types:
Implicit coercion: automatic conversion by JS
Explicit coercion: manual conversion (e.g., Number('5'))

Loops with Examples
for loop
Used to run a block of code a specific number of times.

Example:
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { console.log(i); }

while loop
Runs as long as the condition is true.

Example:
let i = 0; 
while (i < 5) { console.log(i); i++; }

do...while loop
Runs the code block at least once, then checks the condition.

Example:
let i = 0; 
do { console.log(i); i++; } 
while (i < 5);
