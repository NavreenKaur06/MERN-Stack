Day 1 - [19th June 2025]

 TOPICS COVERED (HTML BASICS)

Introduction to HTML:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of a web document.

Basic Structure of an HTML Page:
An HTML page starts with <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, followed by <html>, <head>, and <body> tags that define the overall structure.

HTML Elements:
HTML uses tags (like <p>, <a>, <img>) to define and display different types of content.

Attributes:
Attributes provide additional information about elements. Examples: href for links, src for images, alt for image descriptions.

Headings & Paragraphs:
HTML offers six levels of headings <h1> to <h6> for titles and sections, and <p> for paragraphs of text.

Links:
The <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks that connect to other pages or websites using the href attribute.

Images:
The <img> tag is used to display images on a webpage. It uses src (image source) and alt (alternative text) attributes.

HTML Lists:
HTML provides ordered lists <ol> (numbered) and unordered lists <ul> (bulleted) to display items in a list format.

Tables:
The <table> element is used to display tabular data. It is structured using <tr> (table row), <td> (table data), and <th> (table header).

Forms:
The <form> tag is used to collect user input. It can contain various input fields and controls for data submission.

Input Types:
Common input types include text, password, email, number, and more for different types of user data.

Labels & Buttons:
The <label> tag associates text with form controls, and <button> is used for clickable buttons for user interaction.

HTML5 Semantic Elements:
Elements like <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, etc., provide meaning to the page structure for better readability and accessibility.
