Day 12 – [4th July 2025]

 TOPICS COVERED

React.js Advanced Basics
1. Restructuring (Destructuring) in React
Destructuring is used to extract values from objects or arrays into separate variables easily.

In React, it is commonly used:
•To extract props in functional components for cleaner code.
•To extract values from state objects.
•Example concept (no code):
Instead of writing props.name, you destructure as const { name } = props.

2. useScript (Custom Hook for Loading External Scripts)
useScript is not a built-in React hook. It is a custom hook pattern used to dynamically load external scripts (like third-party libraries) in React apps.

Helps in:
•Integrating external JavaScript libraries easily.
•Loading scripts only when needed, improving performance.
•Example concept:
If you want to use a library like PayPal SDK, you can create a useScript hook to load its script tag dynamically in a component.

Why useScript is important?
• Keeps component code clean
• Avoids global script tags in HTML
• Ensures scripts load only when that component mounts

TOOLS USED
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Node.js and npm
React (with functional components and hooks)
